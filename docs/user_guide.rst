User Guide
**********

This document is intended to be a user guide to inform on how to use the 
Cloud Inquisitor UI.

=========
Dashboard
=========

By default, the front-end dasbhoard shows:

* EC2 Instances that are running or stopped and which instances have a public IP.
* Percentage of ``required tags`` compliance per account.

Below is a sample screenshot showing what the dashboard looks like:

On the left-hand side of the UI, you are able to directly examine raw data:

* EC2 Instances - shows all the EC2 Instance data that Cloud Inquisitor possess, 
which should represent all EBS volumes in use in your AWS infrastructure
* EBS Volumes - shows all the EBS Volume data that Cloud Inquisitor possess, which 
should represent all EBS volumes in use in your AWS infrastructure
* DNS - shows all the dns data that Cloud Inquisitor possess (shown below, first 
screenshot)
* Search - this gives you the ability to search for instances across the Cloud 
Inquisitor database. The ``search`` page has help functionality within the page
as shown below (second screenshot)
